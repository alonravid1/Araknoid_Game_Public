# Arkanoid Game

A project for the OOP course I am (currently) taking as part of my computational biology BA.
The project is written in java, with compliance to the Sun coding style.
In this project I build a complete gameLevel based on the [1986 video gameLevel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid)
step by step, expanding it with every assingment.

Due to the fact that the original project contained some sensitive information in every commit, I had to remove it all and reupload the project without past commits.
